### Keeping `CitrusStylesSE` Framework Consistent:
- Adding new styles to CitrusStylesSE requires both careful consideration and clear documentation. This ensures consistency, maintainability, and avoids confusion for the team moving forward. Here's how:
Explain your reasons:
- Before diving into code, document the need for the new style. Explain the problem it solves or the improvement it brings. This context helps others understand the purpose and value of the change.
Document the changes: 
- Once you've written the new code, document it meticulously. This includes:
- A descriptive comment within the code itself: Briefly explain what the new style does and how it's used.
- An update in the CitrusStylesSE framework documentation: Explain the new style within the existing documentation, including how to use it and potential interactions with other styles.
- Visual examples: Screenshots or code snippets showcasing the new style in action can be incredibly helpful for understanding its impact.
Share and discuss:
- Present your changes to the team, explaining the rationale, documentation updates, and visual examples. This transparency fosters collaboration, identifies potential conflicts, and ensures everyone's on the same page.
Remember:
- Documenting new styles takes time, but it pays off in the long run.
- Clear explanations and visual aids make understanding and using the new style easier for everyone.
- Consistent documentation keeps CitrusStylesSE framework clean, maintainable, and a pleasure to work with.
By following these steps, we can ensure that all additions to the CitrusStylesSE framework are well-informed, documented, and understood by the entire team. This collaborative approach contributes to a stronger, more cohesive framework for everyone to build upon.
